# BHTool - Used to Bash Scripts, Now are C++ Binaries
==============

Using a collection of bash scripts I use frequently as the basis for a project to refresh my C++ skills and skills around creating command line utilities.


```shell
mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make all test
```

## Usage

```
bhtool <command> [<sub-command>] [options]
```
